HtmlMatchers
============

This Rails plugin provides a layer of abstraction on top of Rspec for testing
HTML contents.

It depends on Rspec and Hpricot: rspec, and rspec-rails because enhancing them
is the whole point of this plugin, and Hpricot because I find it so much more
capable, and faster than the assert_select that is built into Rails.

Using from Cucumber
===================

Add require 'cucumber/rails/rspec' to features/support/env.rb.

This is important, so that rspec matchers are in play.
